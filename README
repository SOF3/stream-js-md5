jMd5

Allows you to stream md5 data and hash at the very end which is very efficient when working with files.
This file is based off Joseph Myers' version found at http://www.myersdaily.org/joseph/javascript/md5-text.html.

The progressive portion is based off PHP's implementation. See http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-init.php

------Instructions-------

Basically, you just need to call:
var md5Hash = window.jsMd5.hash(string)

If you want to stream data:
var state = window.jsMd5.init();
while () {
    window.jsMd5.update(state, string);
}
var md5Hash = window.jsMd5.finalize(state);
